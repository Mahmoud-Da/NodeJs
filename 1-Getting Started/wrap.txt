*** 2- What is Node ***
## Lecture Notes – Introduction to Node.js

### 1. What is Node.js?

* **Definition**: Open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside the browser.
* **Primary Use**: Building backend services, also called APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

### 2. Role of Node.js in Applications

* **Client Applications**:

  * Examples: Web apps in browsers, mobile apps on devices.
  * These are the *surface layer* — what the user sees and interacts with.
* **Backend Services**:

  * Store data, send emails, push notifications, initiate workflows, etc.
  * Node.js is ideal for **highly scalable**, **data-intensive**, and **real-time** backend services.

### 3. Why Choose Node.js Over Other Backend Tools?

* **Alternative frameworks**: ASP.NET, Rails, Django, etc.
* **Advantages of Node.js**:

  1. Easy to start, good for prototyping and agile development.
  2. Capable of building **fast** and **highly scalable** production services.
  3. Used by large companies like PayPal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart.

     * PayPal case study:

       * Built twice as fast with fewer people.
       * 33% fewer lines of code.
       * 40% fewer files.
       * Double requests per second.
       * 35% lower average response time.

### 4. Additional Benefits of Node.js

* **JavaScript on both front-end and back-end**:

  * Easier for front-end developers to transition to full-stack.
  * No need to learn a new programming language.
  * Cleaner, more consistent source code (same naming conventions, tools, and best practices).
* **Largest ecosystem of open-source libraries**:

  * Nearly any feature or building block can be added using free libraries.
  * Reduces need to build from scratch, allowing focus on core application logic.

### 5. Next Topic

* Node.js architecture.
