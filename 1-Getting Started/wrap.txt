*** 2- What is Node ***
## Lecture Notes – Introduction to Node.js

### 1. What is Node.js?

* **Definition**: Open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside the browser.
* **Primary Use**: Building backend services, also called APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

### 2. Role of Node.js in Applications

* **Client Applications**:

  * Examples: Web apps in browsers, mobile apps on devices.
  * These are the *surface layer* — what the user sees and interacts with.
* **Backend Services**:

  * Store data, send emails, push notifications, initiate workflows, etc.
  * Node.js is ideal for **highly scalable**, **data-intensive**, and **real-time** backend services.

### 3. Why Choose Node.js Over Other Backend Tools?

* **Alternative frameworks**: ASP.NET, Rails, Django, etc.
* **Advantages of Node.js**:

  1. Easy to start, good for prototyping and agile development.
  2. Capable of building **fast** and **highly scalable** production services.
  3. Used by large companies like PayPal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart.

     * PayPal case study:

       * Built twice as fast with fewer people.
       * 33% fewer lines of code.
       * 40% fewer files.
       * Double requests per second.
       * 35% lower average response time.

### 4. Additional Benefits of Node.js

* **JavaScript on both front-end and back-end**:

  * Easier for front-end developers to transition to full-stack.
  * No need to learn a new programming language.
  * Cleaner, more consistent source code (same naming conventions, tools, and best practices).
* **Largest ecosystem of open-source libraries**:

  * Nearly any feature or building block can be added using free libraries.
  * Reduces need to build from scratch, allowing focus on core application logic.

### 5. Next Topic

* Node.js architecture.

## Lecture Notes – What is a Runtime Environment?

### 1. Recap from Previous Video

* **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.

### 2. What is a Runtime Environment?

* **Before Node.js**:

  * JavaScript was used only for applications running inside browsers.
  * Browsers include a **JavaScript engine** that converts JavaScript into machine code.
* **Examples of JavaScript Engines**:

  * Microsoft Edge → Chakra
  * Firefox → SpiderMonkey
  * Chrome → V8
* **Browser Runtime Environment**:

  * Provides built-in objects like `window` and `document`.
  * Allows interaction with the browser environment.

### 3. The Birth of Node.js (2009)

* Created by **Ryan Dahl**.
* Idea: Execute JavaScript **outside** the browser.
* Approach:

  * Took **Google’s V8 engine** (fastest JS engine at the time).
  * Embedded it into a **C++ program**.
  * Named the program **Node**.

### 4. Node.js Runtime Environment vs Browser Runtime Environment

* Both use **V8** JavaScript engine.
* **Node.js** environment objects:

  * No `document` object.
  * Includes modules to:

    * Work with the file system.
    * Listen for network requests.
    * Perform server-side tasks not possible in browsers.
* **Browsers**: Limited to DOM manipulation, UI interaction, etc.

### 5. Common Misconceptions

* **Node.js is not a programming language**:

  * JavaScript is the language; Node is the runtime.
  * Comparing Node to C#, Ruby, etc., is incorrect.
* **Node.js is not a framework**:

  * Frameworks like ASP.NET, Rails, Django are for building applications.
  * Node provides the runtime environment, not a development framework.
