## Lecture Notes

### 1. Common Questions About Automated Testing

Developers often ask:

* What is automated testing?
* Is it a replacement for manual testing?
* Do I really need it?
* How should I do it?
* Should I use test-driven development (TDD) or write application code first?
* What exactly should I test?

These questions form the foundation of this course, and each will be answered step by step.

## 2. What Is Automated Testing?

Automated testing is the practice of writing code that tests our application code and running those tests automatically.

In any project, your source code will consist of:

* **Application (production) code**
* **Test code**

## 3. Manual Testing vs Automated Testing

### Manual Testing Workflow

To test a function manually:

1. Launch the application in the browser.
2. Possibly log in.
3. Navigate to the page where the function is used.
4. Fill a form and submit it.
5. Observe the output on screen.
6. Repeat all steps for every different input you want to test.

This approach:

* Is slow and repetitive.
* Takes several minutes per test.
* Becomes impossible to scale as your application grows.
* Must be repeated for dozens or hundreds of functions.

### Automated Testing Workflow

With automated testing:

* You directly call the function in code.
* You pass various inputs programmatically.
* You verify (assert) the returned outputs.
* You can run all tests automatically whenever:

  * You change your code.
  * You commit to source control.
  * You deploy your application.

This approach:

* Tests all execution paths in less than a second.
* Supports hundreds or thousands of tests.
* Takes only a few seconds to run the entire test suite.

## 4. Why Automated Testing Matters

Automated testing:

* Saves enormous time.
* Improves reliability.
* Ensures you do not break existing features when adding new ones.

Further benefits will be discussed in the next lecture.
