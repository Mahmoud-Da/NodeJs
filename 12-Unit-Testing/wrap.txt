## Lecture Notes

### 1. Common Questions About Automated Testing

Developers often ask:

* What is automated testing?
* Is it a replacement for manual testing?
* Do I really need it?
* How should I do it?
* Should I use test-driven development (TDD) or write application code first?
* What exactly should I test?

These questions form the foundation of this course, and each will be answered step by step.

## 2. What Is Automated Testing?

Automated testing is the practice of writing code that tests our application code and running those tests automatically.

In any project, your source code will consist of:

* **Application (production) code**
* **Test code**

## 3. Manual Testing vs Automated Testing

### Manual Testing Workflow

To test a function manually:

1. Launch the application in the browser.
2. Possibly log in.
3. Navigate to the page where the function is used.
4. Fill a form and submit it.
5. Observe the output on screen.
6. Repeat all steps for every different input you want to test.

This approach:

* Is slow and repetitive.
* Takes several minutes per test.
* Becomes impossible to scale as your application grows.
* Must be repeated for dozens or hundreds of functions.

### Automated Testing Workflow

With automated testing:

* You directly call the function in code.
* You pass various inputs programmatically.
* You verify (assert) the returned outputs.
* You can run all tests automatically whenever:

  * You change your code.
  * You commit to source control.
  * You deploy your application.

This approach:

* Tests all execution paths in less than a second.
* Supports hundreds or thousands of tests.
* Takes only a few seconds to run the entire test suite.

## 4. Why Automated Testing Matters

Automated testing:

* Saves enormous time.
* Improves reliability.
* Ensures you do not break existing features when adding new ones.

Further benefits will be discussed in the next lecture.

# Benefits of Automated Testing

## Lecture Notes

### 1. Why Write Code to Test Code?

A common question from developers is:
**Why write code to test our code when we can just run the application and check the result manually?**

In the previous lecture, we saw that automated tests save time and let you test frequently.
But there are deeper and more important benefits.

## 2. Catching Bugs Before Deployment

The most significant benefit of automated testing is the ability to detect bugs **before** deploying the application.

This leads to:

* Fewer production issues
* More confidence when releasing features
* Less stress and fewer emergency fixes after deployment

Many developers have experienced situations where:

* They deploy the app thinking everything works
* Later receive a call saying a major feature is broken
* Return to the office expecting a quick fix
* End up staying late into the night

Automated tests do not eliminate all bugs, but they **significantly reduce** the number of issues that reach production.

## 3. Confidence When Refactoring

Refactoring is the process of improving code structure **without** changing its behavior.

Examples:

* Extracting part of a method into a separate private method
* Renaming a method
* Reorganizing logic to improve readability and maintainability

Without automated tests:

* Every refactor requires manual testing
* Manual testing is slow, repetitive, and error-prone
* As the application grows, developers may forget parts of the system affected by the change

With automated tests:

* You can refactor freely
* You run the test suite to ensure you did not break existing functionality
* You maintain cleaner and higher-quality code with confidence

---

## 4. Better Code Quality

Writing tests forces you to:

* Think about how each method behaves
* Consider different inputs and boundary conditions
* Handle edge cases
* Design cleaner, more modular functions

This leads to better overall code quality.
