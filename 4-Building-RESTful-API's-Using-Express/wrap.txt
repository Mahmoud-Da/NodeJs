*** 1- Introduction ***
**Lecture Notes: Express Framework Introduction**

**1. Recap of the HTTP Module**

* In Section 2, we learned about Node’s module system and the use of the built-in **HTTP module**.
* The HTTP module allows us to create a **web server** that listens on a specific port (e.g., port **3000**) and responds to requests sent to various **endpoints** such as:

  * `/` (root)
  * `/api/courses`

**2. Limitation of the HTTP Module Approach**

* While using the HTTP module directly works for small projects, it becomes inefficient and difficult to manage in **large or complex applications**.
* The main problem is the need to **hard-code multiple `if` statements** to handle different routes and endpoints, which quickly makes the code messy and hard to maintain.

**3. Introduction to Express**

* **Express** is a **fast, lightweight, and flexible framework** for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.
* It simplifies the process of:

  * Handling routes
  * Managing HTTP requests and responses
  * Organizing code in a clean and modular way

**4. Next Topic**

* The next section will cover **RESTful services**, a key concept in building structured and scalable web APIs using Express.


*** 2- RESTful Services ***
**Lecture Notes: Introduction to RESTful Services (RESTful APIs)**

**1. Overview**

* REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**.
* RESTful services (or RESTful APIs) are a **convention for building HTTP services** that enable communication between clients (frontends) and servers (backends).
* These services allow applications to **create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)** data using standard **HTTP protocol** principles.

---

**2. Client-Server Architecture Recap**

* Most modern applications follow the **client-server model**.

  * **Client (frontend)**: The app users interact with.
  * **Server (backend)**: Manages and provides data or functionality.
* Communication between the client and server occurs through **HTTP requests**, the same protocol used for web browsing.
* The server exposes services (APIs) that clients can call to perform actions such as retrieving or saving data.

---

**3. Purpose of REST**

* REST provides a **standardized convention** for designing and accessing these HTTP services.
* It allows developers to use existing HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations:

  * **Create** → `POST`
  * **Read** → `GET`
  * **Update** → `PUT`
  * **Delete** → `DELETE`

---

**4. Example: Vidly Movie Rental Company**
Imagine a company called **Vidly** that rents movies.

* The client app manages a list of customers.
* The server exposes a RESTful service at an endpoint like:

  ```
  https://vidly.com/api/customers
  ```

**Endpoint Structure Explained:**

1. **HTTP or HTTPS:**

   * `HTTP` for normal communication.
   * `HTTPS` for secure communication (encrypted data transfer).
2. **Domain:**

   * Example: `vidly.com`
3. **/api:**

   * Common convention to indicate that the path refers to API services (optional but widely used).
   * Could also appear as a subdomain, e.g., `https://api.vidly.com/customers`
4. **/customers:**

   * Refers to a **resource** in the application.
   * In REST, resources represent data entities such as customers, movies, or rentals.

**5. HTTP Methods and Their Uses**

| Method     | Purpose       | Example Endpoint          | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GET**    | Retrieve data | `GET /api/customers`      | Returns a list of all customers.                                                             |
|            |               | `GET /api/customers/1`    | Returns details of a single customer by ID.                                                  |
| **POST**   | Create data   | `POST /api/customers`     | Creates a new customer; the client sends the customer object in the request body.            |
| **PUT**    | Update data   | `PUT /api/customers/1`    | Updates an existing customer; includes the full updated customer object in the request body. |
| **DELETE** | Remove data   | `DELETE /api/customers/1` | Deletes the customer with the specified ID.                                                  |

**6. Key Concepts in REST**

* **Resources:** Entities such as `customers`, `movies`, or `rentals` that the API exposes.
* **Endpoints:** URLs that represent these resources.
* **HTTP Methods (Verbs):** Indicate the desired operation (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* **Request Body:** Data sent by the client when creating or updating a resource (POST and PUT).

---

**7. What We Will Build**

* In this section, we will use the **Express framework** to build a RESTful service for managing a list of customers.
* Instead of connecting to a database, we will use a **simple in-memory array** to store customer data for simplicity.
* Later in the course, we will integrate a **database** for persistent storage.

---

**Summary**

* REST is a structured way of building HTTP services that follow predictable patterns.
* Each resource is accessed through a meaningful endpoint and standard HTTP methods.
* Express simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs, allowing developers to easily define endpoints and handle requests.
