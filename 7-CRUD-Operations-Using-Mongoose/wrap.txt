### **Lecture Notes: Introduction to MongoDB in Node/Express Applications**

#### **1. The Problem with In-Memory Storage**

* Currently, the *vid.ly* (or *bit.ly*) application stores the list of genres in an in-memory array.
* This is not suitable for real-world applications because:

  * When the server restarts, all data in memory is lost.
* To ensure data persistence, we must store our data in a **database**.

#### **2. Choosing a Database**

* When developing applications with **Node.js** and **Express**, there are many database options.
* In this course, we will use **MongoDB**:

  * It is a popular and widely used **database management system**.
  * It is commonly paired with **Node.js** and **Express**.
  * It is beginner-friendly and integrates smoothly with JavaScript.

#### **3. What is MongoDB?**

* **MongoDB** is a **NoSQL** or **document-based database**.
* It differs from traditional **relational databases** (like SQL Server or MySQL) in several ways:

  * No concept of **tables**, **schemas**, **views**, **records**, or **columns**.
  * It does **not require pre-defined structure** (schema-less).
  * You can directly store **JSON objects** (JavaScript Object Notation) in MongoDB.
  * You can query and retrieve JSON objects directly without transformation.

#### **4. Data Handling Example**

* Suppose we have an array of *genres* in memory.

  * In MongoDB, we can store this array of objects directly in a **collection**.
  * When retrieving data, MongoDB returns JSON objects that can be sent directly to the client.

#### **5. Learning Scope**

* This course will provide enough knowledge to use MongoDB effectively in a Node/Express application.
* However, MongoDB itself is large enough to require a full separate course.
* The goal here is **not to become a MongoDB expert**, but to **learn enough to get the job done**.

#### **6. Next Steps**

* The next part of the lecture will demonstrate:

  * How to **install MongoDB** on your local machine.
  * How to start using it within your Node.js environment.
