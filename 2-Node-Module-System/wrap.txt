**Lecture Notes: Node.js Module System**

**1. Overview**

* This section introduces the **module system** in Node.js.
* It explains what **modules** are, why they are **necessary**, and how they **function**.

**2. Purpose of Modules**

* Modules help organize code into **separate, reusable components**.
* They allow developers to maintain **clean and manageable** codebases.
* Modules prevent **naming conflicts** and support **encapsulation** of functionality.

**3. Core Node.js Modules Covered**
Throughout this section, the following built-in Node.js modules will be explored:

* **Operating System (os):** Provides information about the operating system.
* **File System (fs):** Enables reading from and writing to files.
* **Events:** Allows handling and emitting of custom events.
* **HTTP:** Enables building web servers and handling HTTP requests and responses.

**4. Creating Custom Modules**

* In addition to using built-in modules, you will learn how to **create your own modules**.
* This includes **defining**, **exporting**, and **importing** custom functionality for reuse across files.

**5. Summary**

* Modules are a fundamental part of Node.js architecture.
* They make it easier to structure, maintain, and extend applications.
* Understanding both built-in and custom modules is essential for effective Node.js development.
