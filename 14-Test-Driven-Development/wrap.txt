*** 1- What is Test-driven Development ***
### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

#### 1. Definition

Test-driven development (TDD), also called *test first*, is a software development approach in which tests are written **before** the application (production) code.

---

### 2. The TDD Workflow

TDD consists of a simple repetitive cycle:

1. **Write a failing test**

   * The test must fail initially because no application code exists to satisfy it.

2. **Write the simplest code to make the test pass**

   * Implement only the minimal logic required.
   * Avoid over-engineering, premature class design, or unnecessary complexity.

3. **Refactor the code**

   * Clean up the implementation while keeping all tests passing.

These three steps are repeated until the entire feature is implemented.

---

### 3. Why Use TDD?

#### a. Immediate Testability

Your code is testable from the first line since tests come before implementation.

#### b. High Test Coverage

Every line of production code exists only because a test required it.
This leads to complete test coverage, making refactoring and deployment safer.

#### c. Reduced Complexity

Starting with tests prevents over-engineering.
If all tests pass and the system meets all requirements, additional code is unnecessary.
New requirements start with new failing tests.

---

### 4. TDD vs. Code-First Approach

#### TDD (Test First)

* Tests drive the design and implementation.
* Offers strong safety through full test coverage.
* Often leads to simpler and cleaner designs.

#### Code First

* The developer writes application code first, then tests afterward.
* This is how most beginners and many teams naturally work.

---

### 5. Which Approach Is Better?

* **In theory:** TDD provides better quality, better design, and safer refactoring.
* **In practice:** TDD can grow complex and sometimes slow down development.
* When TDD becomes impractical, switching to the code-first approach is reasonable.

*** 2- Implementing the Returns ***
---

### Implementing a New Feature with Test-Driven Development

**Goal:** Add the ability to return a movie.

---

### 1. Rental Model Overview

The `Rental` model has the following properties:

* `customer`
* `movie`
* `dateOut`
* `dateReturned`
* `rentalFee`

The last two properties (`dateReturned` and `rentalFee`) are initially undefined.
When a customer returns a movie, the system must:

1. Set the return date.
2. Calculate the rental fee.

---

### 2. API Design Considerations

#### Existing behavior

The current `/api/rentals` endpoint supports only creating a new rental through a POST request.

#### Incorrect approach

One idea might be to add an update route to modify an existing rental.
However, this approach is flawed:

* The client should **not** set `dateReturned` or `rentalFee`.
  If allowed, a client could send incorrect or manipulated values, such as a rental fee of zero.
* The client should also not modify `dateOut`, the `customer`, or other protected fields.

These values must be calculated and set **only** on the server.

---

### 3. Correct API Approach

Create a new endpoint dedicated to processing movie returns.

**Endpoint:**
`POST /api/returns`

**Request Body:**

* `customerId`
* `movieId`

**Server Responsibilities:**

1. Look up the rental associated with the given `customerId` and `movieId`.
2. Set the `dateReturned` to the current date/time.
3. Calculate the `rentalFee`.
4. Save the updated rental and return a response.

This endpoint becomes the contract exposed to clients for returning movies.

---

### 4. Preparing for Test-Driven Development

Now that the endpoint design and behavior are defined, we can begin writing test cases.
The tests will specify how this endpoint should behave before writing the actual implementation.

---

*** 3- Test Cases ***

---

### Brainstorming Test Cases for the Returns Endpoint

Before writing the implementation, we first identify all the test cases for the `POST /api/returns` endpoint.
This list may evolve as the feature becomes clearer.

---

## 1. Negative Test Cases

These tests ensure the endpoint correctly handles invalid or incomplete requests.

### a. Authentication

* **Return 401** if the client is not logged in.
  Only authenticated users should be able to call this endpoint.

### b. Missing Input

* **Return 400** if `customerId` is not provided.
* **Return 400** if `movieId` is not provided.

### c. Rental Not Found

* **Return 404** if there is no rental matching the provided `customerId` and `movieId`.

### d. Rental Already Processed

* **Return 400** if the rental exists but has already been returned
  (meaning `dateReturned` is already set).

---

## 2. Positive Test Cases

These tests cover correct behavior when the request is valid.

### a. Valid Request

* **Return 200** for a successful return operation.

### b. Set Return Date

* The endpoint should set `dateReturned` to the current date and time.

### c. Calculate Rental Fee

* The rental fee should be computed based on the rental duration and movie daily rental rate.

### d. Update Movie Inventory

* The movie’s stock count should be increased by one.

### e. Response Body

* The endpoint should return the updated rental object, including:

  * `dateOut`
  * `dateReturned`
  * `rentalFee`
  * `customer`
  * `movie`
  * Any other relevant properties

---

### Summary

These test cases define how the `/api/returns` endpoint should behave under different conditions.
In the next steps, each test will be implemented using the TDD cycle.
