*** 1- What is Test-driven Development ***
### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

#### 1. Definition

Test-driven development (TDD), also called *test first*, is a software development approach in which tests are written **before** the application (production) code.

### 2. The TDD Workflow

TDD consists of a simple repetitive cycle:

1. **Write a failing test**

   * The test must fail initially because no application code exists to satisfy it.

2. **Write the simplest code to make the test pass**

   * Implement only the minimal logic required.
   * Avoid over-engineering, premature class design, or unnecessary complexity.

3. **Refactor the code**

   * Clean up the implementation while keeping all tests passing.

These three steps are repeated until the entire feature is implemented.

### 3. Why Use TDD?

#### a. Immediate Testability

Your code is testable from the first line since tests come before implementation.

#### b. High Test Coverage

Every line of production code exists only because a test required it.
This leads to complete test coverage, making refactoring and deployment safer.

#### c. Reduced Complexity

Starting with tests prevents over-engineering.
If all tests pass and the system meets all requirements, additional code is unnecessary.
New requirements start with new failing tests.

### 4. TDD vs. Code-First Approach

#### TDD (Test First)

* Tests drive the design and implementation.
* Offers strong safety through full test coverage.
* Often leads to simpler and cleaner designs.

#### Code First

* The developer writes application code first, then tests afterward.
* This is how most beginners and many teams naturally work.

### 5. Which Approach Is Better?

* **In theory:** TDD provides better quality, better design, and safer refactoring.
* **In practice:** TDD can grow complex and sometimes slow down development.
* When TDD becomes impractical, switching to the code-first approach is reasonable.
