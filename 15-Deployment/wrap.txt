## Deploying Node Applications

### Overview

There are two primary options for deploying Node applications:

1. Using a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider
2. Using Docker

## 1. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

### Definition

A PaaS provider handles most of the infrastructure tasks for you.

### When to Use

Choose a PaaS if you do not want to manage:

* Servers
* Load balancers
* Reverse proxies
* Application restarts after crashes

### Common Providers

* Heroku
* Google Cloud Platform
* AWS
* Azure

Different developers prefer different providers, but Heroku is used in this course because:

* It is easy to start with
* It has strong documentation
* It provides a comprehensive set of features

### Summary

Use a PaaS if you prefer simplicity and do not want to deal with infrastructure details.

## 2. Docker Deployment

### Definition

Docker allows you to package your application into an image.

### When to Use

Use Docker if you:

* Want full control over your deployment
* Want to deploy to your own web servers
* Need consistent environments across machines

### How It Works

You build a Docker image of your application and deploy that image to any server you choose.
