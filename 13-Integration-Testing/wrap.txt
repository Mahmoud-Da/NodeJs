# Integration Testing Overview

## 1. Unit Tests Recap

* Unit tests are simple and quick to write.
* They execute very fast.
* Best suited for functions that have zero or minimal dependency on external resources.
* Useful for testing small, isolated pieces of logic.

## 2. The Need for Integration Tests

* Real-world applications often rely on one or more external resources such as databases, file systems, or network services.
* Integration tests validate that the application code works correctly together with these external systems.
* Instead of testing components in isolation, integration tests check them as a whole.

## 3. Working With a Real Database

* Integration tests require a real database instance.
* The database is populated with test data before running tests.
* Tests interact with the application exactly as a real client would.

## 4. How Integration Tests Work

1. Prepare test data in the database.
2. Send an HTTP request to the endpoint being tested.
3. Make assertions based on either:

   * The HTTP response.
   * The changes in the database.

### Example

* Sending an HTTP POST request to create a new genre.
* After the request, the test inspects the database to ensure that the new genre has been created.

## 5. Next Steps

* In the next lecture, you will make a few adjustments to the application code to prepare it for integration testing.
